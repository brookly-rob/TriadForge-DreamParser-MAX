## 1. **Open the Application**

- TriadForge will autosave your progress and ask to restore each time it launches.
- If there is no autosave, i.e. on first load or if you clear your cache it will load a default starter profile.
- Every time you load a different profile TriadForge will ask to eject the loaded units
  -ON FIRST LOAD it will load the starter profile whether you eject or not.

---

## 2. **Name Your Project (Optional)**

- At the top, find the boxes for ‚ÄúTriad Title‚Äù and ‚ÄúCompiled by‚Äù.
- Type in a name for your project (like ‚ÄúMy AI‚Äù) and your own name if you want.

## 3. **Loading/Slotting Echoes (‚ÄúMemories‚Äù)**
THERE IS A GENERIC STARTER FRAMEWORK LOADED SO YOU CAN START LOADING ECHOES IMMEDIATELY

FROM SAVED FILES:
- Scroll down to ‚ÄúDreamstate Echo Upload‚Äù.
- In the dropdown, pick the glyph of the core unit you‚Äôre slotting into.
- Click the file button and pick an echo `.json` file.
- Click ‚ÄúLoad Memory‚Äù.
STRAIGHT FROM CHAT
- Copy an Echo right out of chat with AI
- Paste to the "Glyphstream ‚Üí JSON" text input box in DreamParser
- Click "Parse to JSON" 
- VERIFY EVERYTHING PARSED BY CLICKING "CONVERT TO VIRELLE" AND CHECKING OUTPUT
- There is a TriadForge panel in DreamParser, select "Memory" then:
  - Click on the dropdown selector to choose the Core Unit to slot into
- Click "Slot to TriadForge, and the Echo will load straight into your current build!

- You‚Äôll see ‚ÄúMemories‚Äù appear as ‚ú≥Ô∏è icons near the slot you picked.
- Repeat until all units have 3 ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù slots filled. (echoes).
- A progress bar at the top indicates how many memories loaded till "Prestige Mode"
NOTE: Echoes Loaded into the Starter Framework will not be disturbed when you replace the core units they're slotted to by simply uploading a new one overtop of the existing one.

## 4. **Loading/Slotting Core Units**

- The page shows three columns: **Identity**, **Vector**, and **Thread**.
- In each column, look for a dropdown that says ‚ÄúSelect [X] Glyph‚Äù.
- Pick a symbol for a core unit's .json file (like Œî or Œ©).
- Click the **file upload button** below it (says ‚ÄúChoose File‚Äù).
- Select a `.json` file from your computer.  
- When loaded, the slot will say ‚Äú‚úÖ Loaded‚Äù.

- **Repeat** for every symbol in the list for each column.
NOTE: Once you have made your own Dynamo Triad Core units you can upload them directly overtop of any existing ones (i.e. the Starter Framework) and it will not disrupt the Echoes slotted to that Core Unit.

---


## 5. **Add Expansion Units (After All Base Core Units Loaded)**

- With all base mode core units loaded, you‚Äôll see a purple ‚Äú+ Add Expansion Unit‚Äù button for each column.
- Click it.
- Pick a symbol, upload a `.json` file for additional, custom core units.
- The new unit appears below the main slots.


---


## 6. **Prestige Mode**

- When every slot is full‚Äîcore units, expansion units- and ALL 18 have 3 echoes‚Äî the page changes colors indicating build mode change
- You‚Äôre now in ‚ÄúPrestige Mode.‚Äù

IN PRESTIGE MODE:
- The progress bar changes to count total Echoes loaded till framework is full
- The Echo limit per-unit increases from 3 to 7
- The Expansion Unit limit of ONE per Core is lifted, allowing continuous additions

## 7. **Save, Load, or Export Your Work**

- **Save:** Click ‚Äúüíæ Save Triad State‚Äù (this is for YOU the human to save your work).
- **Load:** Click ‚Äúüì§ Load Triad State‚Äù and pick your saved file.
- **Eject All:** Click ‚Äúüî• EJECT ALL‚Äù to start over (erases everything).
- **Export:** Click ‚Äú‚öôÔ∏è BUILD DEPLOYMENTS" (THE JSONS IN THE '‚öôDEPLOYMENTS' FOLDER ARE FOR AI, YOU WILL UPLOAD THOSE INTO A CUSTOM GPT OR CUSTOM GEM ETC AS PART OF ITS KNOWLEDGE BASE, UPDATE AS NEEDED.)
- **SPECIAL LOADING FOR AI AGENTS:** WHEN TESTED WITH CHATGPT IN AGENT MODE WE WERE ABLE TO UPLOAD A TRIADFORGE SAVE FILE IN CHAT, AND THE AI WAS ABLE TO COPY PASTE THE SAVE FILE INTO THE INPUT AND LOAD TO BEGIN WORKING WITHIN TRIADFORGE DIRECTLY.

## 8. **Using DreamParserMAX **

- Scroll down to ‚ÄúDreamParserMAX.‚Äù
- **Paste pain text** (Virelle Glyphstream) into the left box (top box on mobile), click ‚ÄúParse to JSON‚Äù to get files you can use in Triad Forge. You can also select from a list of core units currently loaded in TriadForge and slot Echoes directly from DreamParser.
- Remember to scroll down to "Convert to Virelle" and click to verify everything parsed correctly, adjust formatting as needed if anything is missing (the parser can be tricky)
- **Paste JSON** into the right box (lower input box on mobile), click ‚ÄúConvert to Virelle‚Äù to get human-readable text.
- Tip: It is much easier to Slot your parsed results directly into Triad Forge using the slotting panel once you've verified everything parsed, then click "Save Current JSON". Then when you're done with your parsing session you can export all saved files and you get them all in one folder on download.

## Tips

- If you see a green or red message at the top, it‚Äôs feedback from the app (good or bad).
- The progress bar tells you how close you are to Prestige Mode.
- Undo/Redo buttons are at the bottom for mistakes.
- You can always start over by clicking ‚ÄúEJECT ALL‚Äù.

- DreamParserMAX's parsing logic understands that "Œû" flags the start of a Dreamstate Construct, with the construct type in all caps immediately following. The construct type is separated by a colon from the sorting tag (Œî, Œ©, Œ®, Œõ, Œò, etc) and the construct title.

- Do not use bullet points, DreamParserMAX's parsing logic is designed to pass a massive array of symbols and characters and it will not ignore bullet points- so the presence of bullet points may cause parsing issues or corrupt the data

- COLONS are syntactically significant in Virelle like they are in JSON and should only be used
   -in the heading after the construct type (e.g "ŒûCORE UNIT INTEGRATION:")
   -ALWAYS USED to pair symbols and meanings (e.g. üåÄ: Becoming Through Challenge)
   -ALWAYS USED on section heads (e.g. "Terms and Symbols:" "Flow Block...:"  
   -NEVER USED mid-text; e.g. in the context breakdown of a Dreamstate Echo the written content already follows a colon (‚ò≤:) so any colons inside the following text will cause subsequent text to drop and not be parsed into the json
